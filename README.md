## Features

This is a simple Streamlit UI that can use all Groq models in a ChatGPT-like interface. It needs a Groq API for that. There is a sidebar for modifying temperature, top-p, and maximum tokens. It also has the ability to save chat history as a .txt file if needed.

## Installation

Use any Python >= 3.11 version along with the requirements.txt file in the repository. I used 3.12 with the latest versions of all libraries.

```bash
# Installing using repo file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
